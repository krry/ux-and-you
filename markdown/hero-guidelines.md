## Layout
- leave out text or other page elements; these will have to scale with the screen width, so they will move and change quite a bit
- any overlaid text or other page elements must be layout independent on the x-axis; different screen widths cause text and elements to wrap in different ways

## Color
- imagery used must provide good contrast to overlaid text or page elements; anticipate that overlaid text will move
