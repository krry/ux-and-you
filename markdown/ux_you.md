# UX and You
## What is UX?

* It's an absurd acronym for an absurdly broad field.
* Ostensibly derived from "User eXperience", it's now most often used as a normative crutch to describe whether or not a person likes software.
* A UX occurs when a human interacts with a computer.
* So UX as a discipline considers all the factors that influence a human-computer interaction (or HCI).

## Why is UX?

* UX has arisen as an occupation to bridge the growing gap between people and technology.
* Developers of software and hardware harness applied mathematics to create literal multipliers of human effort.
* As the multipliers become greater and more valuable, they become necessarily more complex and difficult to understand.
* Paradoxically then, as technologies become more capable of improving human lives, they become harder to use and harder to understand.
* I realize that might be a tough pill to swallow, so let me offer an example.

## UX Myths

# UX: Hero or handbrake?
* UX is not yet a science, but will be soon.
* Encompasses more and understands less than psychology, which has had more than a century to become scientific—without success. (DSM-V)
* Simply put, human innovation outpaces the understanding of human innovation.
* Let's debunk (GIF of person falling out of bunk)
** There's nothing right about it.
** It's not about correctness.
** It's all about accessibility.
